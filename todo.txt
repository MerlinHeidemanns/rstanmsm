## TODO


### rstan_msm.fit.R

  *


### rstan_msm_fit.stan

  * mu for t = 1 is insufficient and only makes sense if these are only time-series
  * change but also dgp


### dgp_nt

  * use normal instead of rbinom for testing
  * add random error to transition probabilities

### Extensions

  * extend model to spatial data and use information from neighboring observations to infer the state of the specific cell
