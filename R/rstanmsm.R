#' rstanmsm: A package for Bayesian Inference for Markov Switching Models with Time-Varying Transition Probabilities
#'
#' The package provides an easily accessible format to estimate MSM models with TVTP and for TSCS data.
#'
#' @section Functions
#' The package provides a set of main functions to estimate MSM-TVTP models with varying data.
#' It also includes functions to simulate fake data to check the chosen model's ability to recover
#' the parameters. The third suit of functions allows the user to implement posterior predictive
#' checks (PPCs).
